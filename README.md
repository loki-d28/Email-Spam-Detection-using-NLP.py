TITLE:Email Spam Detection Using NLP

Overview:
    This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning to detect whether an email is spam or not.

Features:

1.Preprocesses email text (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal).
2.Extracts features using Bag-of-Words (BoW) or TF-IDF.
3.Classifies emails using machine learning algorithms.
4.Evaluates performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score.

Technologies Used:

Python
Libraries: NLTK, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy

Dataset:

Public datasets like the SMS Spam Collection Dataset or UCI datasets.
Each record contains:
    label: spam or ham
    text: email content

Installation:

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
